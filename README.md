# <Module 01 Challenge Goodell>

## Description

For my first challenge/homework assignment for the UCF Coding Bootcamp, I was asked to refactor code for the marketing agency so that their codebase followed accessibility standards and so their website would be optimized for search engines.  I decided to build this project to further build my knowledge of semantic HTML elements and industry accesibility guidelines.  I learned the importance of using semantic elements and the benefits they will give my clients as a future software developer.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The purpose of this repository is to demostrate my understanding of semantic HTML elements and proper codebase structure.  This website is not the website of an actual marketing agency.  To see how I organized the code of this page, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I(macOS) or Control+Shift+I(Windows).  A panel called "Elements" should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.  There, you will see my HTML file along with my CSS style sheet under the tab "Styles".
